### Instructions for Test Cases:
### **Dog Class**:
- Contains two attributes: `name` and `age`.
- Includes a constructor to initialize these values.

### Person Class:
- Contains the attributes `name`, `age`, and `Optional<Dog> dog`.
- Includes methods to check if the person owns an old dog (age â‰¥ 10) and to change the dog's name.

## Instructions to Run the Code:

### 1. Compile and Run the Code:
- Make sure your Java project is set up in an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
- Run the `Main` class which demonstrates creating `Person` and `Dog` objects and calling methods like `hasOldDog()` and `changeDogsName()`.

### 2. Running Unit Tests:
1. Ensure JUnit is set up in your project (either through Maven or manually).
2. Use the `JUnit` plugin in your IDE to run the test classes for both `Dog` and `Person`.
3. You can run the tests directly from Eclipse/IntelliJ or via the command line if using Maven.

## Requirements for Unit Tests:
- Tests are written for both the `Dog` and `Person` classes.
- The test methods ensure the correct functionality of the `hasOldDog()` method and the exception handling in `changeDogsName()`.
